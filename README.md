# JavaProject

My project is based on No. 3 from "Proiecte propuse pentru disciplina Programare avansatÄƒ (Java) 2021". I used Discord4J together with Discord Developer Portal, ROME Rss library, and SAX to build a bot able to parse a rss feed and display useful info in the chat in form of messages. This informarion is retrieved on demand through commands like new -> that retrieves the latest piece of news or add -> which lets you add a neu RSS feed source.

see demo.png for how to use the commands
